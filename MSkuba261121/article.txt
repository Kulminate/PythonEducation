Don't leave the room, don't make a mistake.
Why do you need the Sun if you smoke Shipka?
Everything behind the door is meaningless, especially the exclamation of happiness.
Just go to the restroom and return immediately.

Oh, don't leave the room, don't call the motor.
Because the space is made from a hallway
and ends with a counter. And if a live one comes in
sweetheart, mouth opening, drive out without undressing.
